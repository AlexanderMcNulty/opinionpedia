Opinionpedia backend
====================

![Tests](https://github.com/Opinionpedia/opinionpedia/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Source of truth for Opinionpedia's primary data.



Getting started
===============



Pre-requisites
--------------

- Node.js 12.x
- Yarn 1.x



First steps
-----------

Build the server with:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

Make sure you have a MySQL server you can access.

Create a file in this directory called ".env" and populate it like this:

```
HTTP_PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=mysecret
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_DATABASE=mydatabase
```

Now run:

```
yarn start-dev
```

You should see a bunch of text scroll by as we initialize the database. If the
last message is "Listening on port 4000" then congratulations! The server
is up and running.

With the server running, run the tests with:

```
yarn test
```

Next steps:

- Practice creating a profile as described below.
- Skim the API documentation as found below.



Try creating a profile and logging in
-------------------------------------

Here's an illustrative bash script that takes some typical actions. Skim it to
get a feeling for what it does and then try giving it a run.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
host=localhost:4000

send_request() {
    local method="$1"
    local path="$2"
    local body="$3"

    curl -D - -sS -X $method \
                  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                  -d "$body" $host$path
    echo
}

send_request POST /api/profile '{
    "username": "your name",
    "password": "some password",
    "description": null,
    "body": null
}'

send_request POST /api/login '{
    "username": "your name",
    "password": "some password"
}'

echo 'Your authentication token should be displayed (twice), please save it'
```



Deployment
==========

- Make sure the sources are built with `yarn build`.
- Set environment variables appropriate for the deployment environment, or use
  the `.env` file.
- Set `JWT_SECRET` to a string of random bytes.
- Run the server in production mode with `yarn start-prod`.



Development
===========

Run the linter with `yarn lint` before pushing. GitHub is set to run the linter
and try building the project in its CI, so it will notice if lint has any
errors.

Route path: /question/:question_id
Request URL: http://localhost:4000/api/question/123

req.params: {
    "question_id": 123
}
```



Create question
---------------

The created question will be owned by the profile the client is logged into, if
they send an authorization header. Otherwise, it will be owned by the client's
IP address.

```
Method: POST
Path: /question
Headers: {
    Authorization: string | undefined;
}
Request body: {
    prompt: string;
    description: string;
}
```

Example:

```
URL: http://localhost:4000/api/question
Headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer my.jwt.here"
}
Request body: {
    "prompt": "What do you think about X?",
    "description": "I was just wondering..."
}
```



Modify question
---------------

If the question being modified was created by a logged in client, an
authorization header must be provided. Otherwise, the question is considered
owned by an IP address. The client's IP address must match this or it will be
rejected.

```
Method: PATCH
Path: /question/:question_id
Headers: {
    Authorization: string | undefined;
}
Request body: {
    prompt?: string;
    description?: string;

Headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer my.jwt.here"
}
Request body: {
    "prompt": "What does the world think about X?"
}
```



Get question suggestions
------------------------

Get a list of up to three questions with tags similar to the chosen question.
The questions are purposefully selected with an element of randomness, so
repeated calls to this route may produce different responses for the same
inputs.

The algorithm used to select the questions is the following:

1. Create an empty list of question suggestions.
2. Get the list of question tags on the requested question.
3. Search the database for other questions with all of those same tags. Add
   those to the list.
4. If the list has three or more items, pick 3 at random and return.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but search for questions with all but one of the tags.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but search for questions with all but two of the tags.
7. Etc, until we run out of tags. Return what we have at the end.

```
Method: GET
Path: /api/question/:question_id/suggestions
Params: {
    question_id: number;
}
Response body: number[];
Possible errors:
  - HTTP 404: Resource not found
```

Example:

```
URL: http://localhost:4000/api/question/123/suggestions
Response body: [
    1072,
    12,
    889
]
```



Get vote table
--------------

Produces a 2-D array of vote count statistics on a question.

Within the 2-D array, the outer index is option\_id and the inner index is a
tag\_id.

After using this call, you will need to [fetch tag details](#detail-tag) to
learn the names of these tags.

```
Method: GET
Path: /question/:question_id/vote_table
Response body: {
    [option_id: string]: {
        total: number;
        [tag_id: string]: number;
    };
}
Possible errors:
  - HTTP 404: Resource not found
```

Example:

Suppose the database has the following data in it at the time of a call:

- Suppose question 1 has three options with ids 10, 20, and 30.
- Suppose option 10 has three votes, one of which is by a profile tagged
  with tag\_ids 100 and 200, and the other two of which have no tags.
- Suppose option 20 has five votes, each by profiles tagged with tag\_ids 300
  and 400.
- Suppose option 30 has no votes.

```
URL: http://localhost:4000/api/question/1/vote_table
Response body: {
    "10": {
        total: 3,
        "100": 1,
        "200": 1
    },
    "20": {

owned by an IP address. The client's IP address must match this or it will be
rejected.
