// Adds the ability to associate a Conn with a Request object in a safe and
// convenient API.
//
// Request handlers call getConn(req) to get a MySQL connection. Repeated calls
// to this function return the same connection object. If a connection has been
// opened for a request, it is closed in a router middleware that executes
// later in the handling of the request. This means the request handler does
// not need to worry about closing the connection itself.
//
// This API only associates a single connection object per request. If more are
// needed, you'll have to do something different.
